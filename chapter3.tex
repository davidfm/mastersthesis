\chapter{Hummingbird: the open source platform for monitoring and controlling satellites and ground stations}\label{chapter3}

The continuous growth of the popularity of small satellites has been accompanied by an increased interest in creating more a better solutions for the ground segments of the missions. These missions are more complex every time and the use of software oriented for amateurs is starting to prove insufficient. For this reason there are nowadays several projects to build professional-like software and ground station networks to control small satellites. This chapter introduces one of them, \emph{Hummingbird}; the project into which the work carried on in this thesis will be integrated.
