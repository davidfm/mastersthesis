The goal of this project is to develop the calibration and limit checking modules for Hummingbird, an open source software platform for controlling ground stations and satellites which is being developed by CGI Group Inc. in cooperation with the University of Tartu. Hummingbird is presented in detail and its architecture, functionalities and core technologies are described in the work.\\

 

%The goal of Hummingbird is to provide satellite missions with software which can be easily adapted to every mission's needs along with creating a ground stations network to wide their transmission capabilities.\\
The work also gives a short overview of the topics which are most relevant to satellite communications. Such as orbits, communication protocols, the ground segment and ground segment software solutions.\\
%To give the reader some background in satellite communications several parts which need to be taken into account are presented. Orbits and how they affect those transmissions, which data is transmitted, what protocols are used for those communications and the different parts of hardware needed for a ground station to work. In addition, some examples of software used for ground stations are listed.\\

%As the main goal of this work is the integration of its two resulting modules with Hummingbird, the platform is presented. Specially focusing on its architecture, which technologies it uses and the functionalities it offers.\\ 

The software design made in this work was developed in close cooperation with the scientists working on the Estonian student satellite. The result is a completely configurable software prepared to be fully integrated with Hummingbird when necessary.
