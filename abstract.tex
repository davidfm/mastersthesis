The goal of this project is to develop a calibration and a limit checking modules for Hummingbird, an open source platform for controlling ground stations and satellites being developed by CGI in cooperation with the University of Tartu. The goal of Hummingbird is to provide satellite missions with and software easy adaptable to their needs along with creating a ground stations network to wide their transmission capabilities.\\

To accomplish this the characteristics of satellite to Earth communications will be studied. This includes how orbits affect them, what data kinds of data are transmitted, what protocols are used and which hardware is necessary for a ground station to work. Also, some examples of software used for ground stations are listed.\\

Hummingbird is also presented in this work. The idea behind its development and its architecture is important plays an important role in the software developed in this thesis\\

Based on the indications of the scientists working on the ESTCube project a completely configurable software as been designed and implemented. This software is prepared to be fully integrated with Hummingbird when necessary.
