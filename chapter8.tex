\chapter{Future work}

This chapter describes the next steps to be taken towards full integration of the two modules developed in this work with the rest of the system. The process is described here. The future work will be carried out by the author and also by the ESTCube-1 team.\\


\textbf{Unit testing}\\
Even though the software has been fully tested by the author it is intended to also implement unit tests to cover every possible scenario. This will be done with two different tools:
\begin{itemize}
\item JUnit\cite{JUnit}
\item Mockito\cite{Mockito}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Test the integration with ESTCube-1's development build}\\
The Camel code for the modules to be connected with the rest of the system has already been implemented. However, there have been no tests involving the whole system with the two modules working. This work should be carried out before going on any further.\\

\textbf{Integrate with ESTCube-1's live build and with Hummingbird}\\
After the modules have been fully tested in the development environment and have been approved by the people responsible of ESTCube-1's ground segment development they should be integrated into the live build, where they will work with real parameters received from ESTCube-1. In addition, it should also be integrated into Hummingbird when the people in charge of the project consider it convenient.\\
